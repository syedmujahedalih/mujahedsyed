### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Analyst and a certified Tableau Desktop Specialist with 3+ years of experience in analyzing data using Python, Tableau, SQL to convey actionable insights. I graduated with a MS in Computer Engineering from Arizona State University in May 2021. My primary areas of interest are Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Visualization, and Business Intelligence Analytics. I'm actively looking for full-time opportunities in any of the aforementioned roles.

I have experience working with the following tech stack as part of my past internships, academic coursework, or hobby projects:

Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript, C, R, Bash, MATLAB, SQL
Front-End: HTML, CSS, React.JS, Figma, Photoshop
Tools and Databases: Tableau Desktop, Power BI, Alteryx, Git, Apache Spark, PostgreSQL, MS Excel, Snowflake
Python/Machine Learning/Deep Learning Packages and Frameworks: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Sklearn, Keras, Pytorch

Outside of work or academics, I like to be actively involved with the Data & Analytics community. I am a Tableau Student Ambassador and I am looking forward to connecting with the #DataFam on Twitter(@syedmujahed97), LinkedIn, or Clubhouse(@syedmujahed97).
